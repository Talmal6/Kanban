# kanban

Kanban is a visual framework commonly used in agile software development to optimize workflow and enhance team efficiency, typically represented through boards with columns that indicate different stages of a task lifecycle. Building on this idea, this Kanban project is a C# application that uses SQL databases for reliable data storage and employs WPF for an interactive user interface, enabling efficient task tracking and workflow management.
